REWRITE getmetadata function to be universal and handle errors whensearxh results teturn something other than a book


Add stats stuff using search results, republishdate, meta.xml:
	pages published this week, pages published this month, pages published all time (?)
	after you clock out for the day: random pages published today

	weekly stats: page published, % of each language, % of each century

Before tweeting, check to make sure image hasn't been deleted

Before tweeting, check that all characters in hashtags are alphanumeric -- otherwise throw hashtag away

Rewrite using classes:
e.g.

randomID = getRandomID()
currentBook = book(randomID)

pagenum = currentBook.pagenum()
url = currentBook.url()
delete = currentBook.deletedPages()
