iabot

This project is a work in progress, and is the first project that I've uploaded to github.

iabot a twitter bot that you can see in action at http://twitter.com/ctm_books.

It searches the Internet Archive for books that I personally digitized, 
republished, and uploaded. It chooses a random book, and then a random page from within that book.
It then tweets out an that page with whatever twitter account it has been authenticated with.

iabot is written in Python3 and requires the tweepy and internetarchive libraries to be installed 
(among others)


```
python3 random_from_uploader.py -h
usage: random_from_uploader.py [-h] [-v] [-r | -f] [-d] [-o] [-t] searchterm

randomly choose an image from an IA book and tweet it

positional arguments:
  searchterm          what to search for using IA's advance search --
                       generally part of an uploader's username
                        
optional arguments:
  -h, --help          show this help message and exit
  -v, --verbose       display hella feedback
  -r, --random        gives a 35 percent chance of tweeting a foldout, as set
  				      by foldoutChance
  -f, --foldout       tweet a foldout instead of a page
  -d, --disableTweet  run through motions of script but don't actually tweet
  -o, --offline       use existing scandata.xml to test offline components of
                      script
  -t, --timer         will tweet according to other paramters after a random
                      interval between 42 and 260 mintues

example:

./random_from_uploader.py christian-mccusker -vft

will search IA for items whose uploader contains 'christian-mccusker' that also contain foldout pages,
and will tweet them at random intervals. It will be in verbose mode as it does this and provide
debugging information to the command line.

 ```
